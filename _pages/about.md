# Ryden Iwamoto's website

I am a fourth-year student at the University of Chicago studying economics. 
My research interests are in the application of econometrics and causal inference to topics in urban and labor economics. 
I will be an economist with Walmart Economics in Bentonville, Arkansas in August 2026. 

Born and raised in Honolulu, I remain engaged with Hawaii's economic development 
through my roles as a Director of the Oahu Economic Development Board and a Research 
Associate of Chaminade University's Economic Education Center for Excellence.
