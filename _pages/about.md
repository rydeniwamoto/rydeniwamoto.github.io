# Ryden Iwamoto's website

I am a third-year student at the University of Chicago studying mathematics and statistics with an interest in urban, spatial, and trade economics. I serve as co-president of Prism Consulting Group and work as a research associate at Promontory Investment Research. I will be joining the Walmart Economics team in summer 2026.

Born and raised in Honolulu, I remain engaged with Hawaii's economic development through my roles at the Oahu Economic Development Board and Chaminade University's Economic Education Center for Excellence.

My research interests include urban and regional economics, trade, and applied microeconomics.
